# Video_Player

I used JavaFX to to build this project.

To test it You need to run the project and then from the top left corner you have to select File->Open to select a video from your device

you can check all the functionality I was asked(play,pause,rewind,forward) in Controller Class. All the functionality was written mainly in these functions: playVideo,rewindVideo,forwardVideo inside Controller Class.
